It’s just sad that with all your hard work you have put names to the top people involved, that the legal system is unable to prosecute.  I’m a private investigator and my heart was being broken by the sad stories of people who called me after they had been scammed. Of course at that point there was nothing that I could do to help them except try to convince them to report it. Then I came to the conclusion that the best I could do to help people is to educate them before they get scammed so that they won’t get scammed. That’s my little bit that I can do to help. You’re doing the hard work and I am so impressed. My prayers will be with you to give you strength, direction, wisdom and to keep you always safe. Take care."

The only thing that saved me, is that I had pretty fluent knowledge of stocks and I knew that it was impossible for anyone to predict moves with near 100% accuracy, even 85% accuracy is wild.
Also the stocks they were trading were never listed on any legitimate exchange.

52,@Super-id7bq,1 month ago,2,"This is great work. Well done. One thing I have to point out however is that it's not surprising most people don't come forward. Fraud in the UK is practically legal. Me and my wife had our credit card info stolen and had all tons of stuff taken out in our names using our credit (phones, plane tickets, loans etc) and we actually worked out who did it.

They're a massive professional operation (they were able to spoof our phones for bypassing 2 factor authentication so they're sophisticated). I called the police and they said there is nothing they could do. Literally, they wouldn't accept a report. They then said I had to call action fraud which I did but again, all they said was to contact my bank. I eventually had to call crime stoppers in the hopes that they might one day get enough info to follow up but that's unlikely.

The only reason we figured out who it was, was because they had no idea my wife was actually my wife. We had different surnames and different banking addresses at the time, otherwise they likely would have only tried to defraud one of us. This allowed us to pinpoint exactly who it was. My theory after asking around is that they literally use the money to fund terrorist organisations but again, the police aren't even remotely interested. So basically if you want to earn a crap load of money, steal people's credit card info and take out a bunch of phone contracts or buy airline tickets in their names etc - the police will do literally nothing about it.

69,@kentharris7427,1 month ago,0,"After experiencing a rather unsettling ordeal with potential thieves attempting to unlawfully sell my rental property, I was left somewhat disheartened by the response of our federal law enforcement. My impression was that the FBI seemed focused primarily on more straightforward cases, tackling what I've come to term as 'low hanging fruit'.
 
Upon learning about this fraud, I cleverly posed as an interested buyer to gather more evidence about the culprits. I managed to secure their license plate number and even capture video evidence. However, when I took this information to the local police, I was told that, as no money had been exchanged, they were unable to intervene.
 
My subsequent interaction with an FBI agent was similarly disappointing, as they simply suggested I return home without offering any assistance. I refused to give up, though, and instead turned to the bank. I provided them with the information I had gathered, including an account number and name that I suspected were being used for money laundering.
 
Interestingly, the bank's reaction was vastly different. Like a bear attacking a honeycomb, they swiftly took action to investigate the matter, clearly recognizing the potential risk to their reputation and business operations. In conclusion, this experience has left me believing that, sometimes, private institutions may prove more efficient in addressing certain issues than traditional law enforcement. Remember, financial institutions are not fond of their services being used for illegal activities, and they are well-equipped with former police detectives on their payroll to take action once alerted."

It consisted of about a dozen people in Florida & a single producer leading a small troupe of actors in Portland, Oregon, including Jason Glick. Today, most people are familiar with this scam template by the name of one of the most popular brands it invented, which is still being copied: Tesler. The producer got off easy for cooperating with investigators. The ringleaders in Florida were fined heavily. And the actors continue to enjoy growing success in the Portland theater circuit, their local audiences clueless that the characters played a role in the continued theft of millions from people around the world.

112,@ewanc1,1 month ago,0,"I think this is a lesson for us all with the lesson being that no-one is going to save you from these 'people' (I use the word loosely when talking about scammers of any kind). The police/government/regulator are reactive and so will only investigate, if they investigate at all, after the fact i.e. when your money is gone. We are the only ones who can protect us and we have to be vigilant and do our due diligence because no-one's going to do it for us. If it's too good to be true, it almost always is and promises of 80/90% returns should be a big red flag. I feel for the people who have been scammed and it proves that it can happen to anyone."

I was offered either direct debit, credit card or a one week credit costing 10 pounds, 10% interest per week. This is illegal in France as it is usury. Apparently, it is acceptable in the UK. I took it from my credit card card of course which was then debited from my French bank account. I was then contacted repeatedly and threatened with legal procedures by the pay day credit company, they claimed that I had taken the credit option, which is not true as I had the receipt. This not only usury, it is a scam. They have access to the ATM network who normally carefully screen companies they work with. They are obviously not doing their job. They also somehow got hold of my personal data.
I am extra careful when traveling, I keep all my receipts and check my account. You can get scammed by companies that are supposedly legitimate, it all depends on how loose is the regulatory framework of the country you are in. A country with few regulations, or unenforced regulations, or where you can bribe those who enforce them is a paradise for scammers. I suspect that the UK is in the first and second case. The British financial sector is just the wild west. No wonder that is where Russian oligarchs and African dictators take their money to. It just vanishes from any oversight."

All too often, as intimated in this excellent report, the scammers appear to have law enforcement in their pocket and little to fear.

471,@russbuttypennyblackblade,1 month ago,0,"One California midwife said “that since 2020, she’s been seeing…silver/gray placentas. Some of them are shrunken, so not big enough to deliver a normal baby, and many midwives are reporting that they have to deliver babies early because the placenta can’t sustain a full-term baby,” Wolf said on “War Room” Tuesday.

“And she showed me an image of a placenta that was like two inches in circumference – narrower, shorter smaller – than a normal placenta,” she continued, adding that midwives are also seeing “calcifications” on the placentas of vaccinated moms.

Wolf also made an alarming claim that the midwives she’s spoken to haven’t seen any normal placentas since the COVID vaccine rollout, suggesting vaccine shedding may be affecting unvaccinated women.

“Since the vaccines rolled out, she said she’s seeing no normal placentas,” Wolf said. “I asked her to send me an image of a normal placenta post-2020, and she said she doesn’t have any. They’re all compromised. So she’s concerned about shedding compromising the placentas of unvaccinated moms.“

If that wasn’t bad enough, Wolf claimed the midwives are seeing many more early deliveries due to the compromised placentas and health issues in babies soon after birth.

One midwife said “that babies often come out seeming okay, and they go home and they get rushed to the hospital within a day because they are in respiratory distress, and she’s never seen that so frequently before.”"

And even in the narrow sense of everyday investigative routine you can't catch a bad actor if you go at it alone. Such attitude is the main reason we still see international crimes on the rise."

Junk Bonds, Enron, you name it.  I recall  colleagues at Citibank international chorussing greed is good. So when the 'ordinary' person in a weak moment allows the emotion of greed to take control, they're easy meat for the scammers. And the scammers can be the big banks too, it's what banking is about worldwide. Remember, Roosevelt wouldn't allow bankers to take part in Bretton Woods, for a reason."

As crucial as the information presented in the video may be to the general public, it is with great dismay that I express my disappointment towards the monotonous nature of the edits, intonation and overall continuity of the episode. The lack of creativity and spontaneity is not only apparent but also extremely disengaging. 

A more dynamic approach in identifying the key individuals involved in the matter at hand would have gone a long way in keeping the viewers alert and intrigued. It is regrettable that the presentation is lengthy, and the audience is subjected to a torturous experience that requires a tremendous amount of effort to endure.

They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them. They defraud a man of his home, a fellowman of his inheritance. Therefore, the LORD says: ""I am planning disaster against this people, from which you cannot save yourselves. You will no longer walk proudly, for it will be a time of calamity...""

Proverbs22:16 Whoever oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth, or gives to the rich, will only come to poverty.

Rom13:1-4 Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. 2 Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. 3 For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, 4 for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer.""

As always, cling to the truth & wisdom in scripture. These scammers will NOT escape. Great journalism...glad to see it still exists."
